## Building

Requirements:

- macOS 11 or later.
- Xcode command-line tools, installed with `xcode-select --install`.
- Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon, installed with `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.
- The original game application, fully installed.
- For Pirates, Python 3 and network access for the first build's `unicorn` dependency.

The build detects the game from the source app's bundle identifier:

```sh
cd native
make SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO The Hobbit.app" bundle
```

You can also select the game explicitly:

```sh
make GAME=pirates   SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean.app" bundle
make GAME=clonewars SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO Star Wars III.app"            bundle
make GAME=marvel    SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.app"      bundle
make GAME=saga      SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO Star Wars Saga.app"          bundle
make GAME=batman3   SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO Batman 3.app"                 bundle
make GAME=movie     SOURCE_APP="/path/to/The LEGO Movie.app"              bundle
make GAME=hobbit    SOURCE_APP="/path/to/LEGO The Hobbit.app"              bundle
```

The generated compatibility app appears in `native/build/`. The build copies
in the game's data and resources and leaves the original app unchanged.
Open the generated app from Finder or the Dock.

Batman 3, The LEGO Movie, and The Hobbit default to their standard Steam
library locations when `GAME` is specified without `SOURCE_APP`. For other
install locations, pass `SOURCE_APP` explicitly. To check game detection before
building, run `make SOURCE_APP="/path/to/Game.app" game-info`.

`GAME=saga` defaults to the Steam edition and requires `SOURCE_APP`. Its output
is `native/build/LEGOCompleteSaga-Steam-Compat.app`; keep the generated
`LEGOStarWarsSagaData` directory beside it. The retail edition uses
`SAGA_EDITION=retail`. See [native/SAGA.md](native/SAGA.md) for edition-specific
build instructions and [native/MARVEL-STEAM.md](native/MARVEL-STEAM.md) for
Marvel's Steam build instructions.

Pirates automatically unpacks its shipped executable during the build. The
first build creates `native/build/venv` and installs `unicorn`. To use an
existing Python environment with `unicorn`, pass `PYTHON=/path/to/python3`.

To update the loader in an existing compatibility app without copying the
game data again:

```sh
make GAME=hobbit promote-loader
```

Add `CONTINUE_WHEN_INACTIVE=1` to `bundle` or `promote-loader` to keep the game
running while another app is active. It defaults to `0`. To save a personal
build preference, put `CONTINUE_WHEN_INACTIVE = 1` in the git-ignored
`native/local.mk`.
