 * flag through the global.  Pirates calls that init from two threads (the
 * BgProc boot sequence and the main-thread game init), so two SaveCore
 * threads consume a single-consumer ring; when both pop the same job the read
 * index overtakes the write index and the next pop dispatches a never-written
 * slot (type -1 -> call through NULL).  The loader lets the first thread
 * spawn win and makes the constructor publish the run flag already set so the
 * surviving thread does not exit when the second init swaps the worker object.
 * The latch must sit on the bare spawn call, not on the worker's start method:
 * that method also runs the initialisers every published worker needs (save
 * buffer etc.), and the surviving thread serves whichever object is current.

 * load, the material's begin-draw path falls back to a flat-colour program
 * without binding the layer samplers, but the stage binder still follows the
 * material type byte and dereferences the empty slot.  The guard treats an
 * empty slot like a record whose field is zero: the stage is skipped for this
