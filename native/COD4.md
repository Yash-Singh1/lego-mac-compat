# Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (Steam Mac)

This branch ports Aspyr's **1.7.2 Steam Mac release**, app 7940, using the
same i386-in-x86_64 loader as the LEGO games. The `tfu` and `portal2` branches
provided the guest dylib, C++ runtime extraction, and guest context machinery.
The existing main-branch Carbon, OpenGL and audio bridges remain in use.

## Validation status

This is an experimental port with campaign and local multiplayer smoke tests.
On macOS 26.5.2
with an Apple M5 Pro, single-player initializes Steam, plays the intro movies,
renders the main menu, creates a profile, and starts or resumes the F.N.G.
training mission. Menu selection and pause/resume work. The mission advances
to the rifle pickup objective and writes a save in the test profile.

The training room now renders opaque world geometry, weapons, characters,
lighting, foliage and the HUD. The obsolete exclusive-fullscreen AGL request
previously failed and triggered a fallback with no depth or stencil buffer,
allowing the skybox to overwrite the world. The compatibility window now
retains the requested depth/stencil format (32/8 on the tested GPU).
No diagnostic shader replacements or draw overrides are included.

Both executables pass their dependency/initializer checks (45 single-player,
49 multiplayer). Multiplayer plays its intro, creates/selects a profile, opens
the server setup, loads a password-protected local Ambush map, and spawns after
team/class selection. The spawned view renders the buildings, terrain, weapon
and HUD correctly; firing produces impacts and reload input plays the reload
animation. The original PunkBuster modules now initialize without the startup
error; joining a protected server has not been verified. An Internet server
connection also completed its HTTP mod downloads and reached the active
Backlot map in spectator mode, followed the server's relocation redirect,
and reached team selection on Overgrown at the replacement server.
Voice chat, sustained online gameplay,
held movement/mouse-look, controller input, and audible output have not been
verified. Automated key taps did not establish continuous movement. Interactive probes
use isolated profiles and muted audio, leaving the Steam installation unchanged.

Intermittent bursts of gameplay static and camera-dependent mesh stretching
remain reported issues. The latest static report has timing logs but no audio
capture, so its cause has not been established.

## Converter app

Build the standalone converter with `make -C native cod4-converter` from the
repository root. Open `native/build/COD4-Converter.app` and select **Campaign**
or **Multiplayer**. Click **Find in Steam**, choose the game manually, or drag
`Call of Duty 4.app` or its Steam game folder into the window. Discovery also
accepts Steam library/common folders and the nested multiplayer app.

Choose an output folder. Campaign creates `COD4-Compat.app`; Multiplayer
creates `COD4MP-Compat.app`. **Convert Another** returns to the selection flow
so both editions can be created. Existing copies receive numbered siblings
instead of being replaced, preserving their data and saves. Each app contains
its own roughly 7 GB game-data copy. Cancel removes the unfinished copy.

The converter is universal (Apple Silicon and Intel), includes the current
game loader, and uses only macOS system tools. Its users need no Python,
Make, Xcode, or repository checkout. Games require Rosetta 2 on Apple Silicon
and the supported Aspyr Steam Mac 1.7.2 installation. Open Steam with the
owning account before launching the generated game.

On the first conversion, it downloads Apple's 4.72 GB Lion archive, verifies
its checksum, and extracts the two private C++ libraries without running an
installer. Later conversions reuse the verified cache at
`~/Library/Caches/org.32bitgoofy.COD4Converter/`. The converter itself contains
no game assets or Apple runtime libraries. Its workflow is adapted from the
TFU and Portal 2 converters.

Validation includes the GUI's Steam detection and completed Campaign flow;
both real Steam modes converted from a relocated converter, with archive
extraction, signature checks, original data hashes, and all guest initializers
passing. Tests also cover cached reuse, existing-copy preservation, literal
paths, cancellation, staging cleanup, and an unchanged Steam installation.
The GUI converter's tests are `make -C native test-cod4-converter`; the real
installation integration test is
`python3 native/tests/test_cod4_converter_integration.py` (optionally pass
`--installer /path/to/InstallMacOSX-Lion.dmg` to exercise archive extraction).

## Command-line build

Requires macOS, the Xcode command-line tools, Python 3, Rosetta 2 on Apple
Silicon, and your installed Steam Mac copy of the game. Start Steam with the
account that owns the game before launching a converted app.

```sh
cd native
make cod4-runtime
make GAME=cod4 bundle
make GAME=cod4mp bundle
```

Steam's default library and additional libraries from `libraryfolders.vdf`
are searched automatically. To select a particular installation, pass the
**outer single-player app** for either edition:

```sh
make GAME=cod4 SOURCE_APP="/path/to/Call of Duty 4.app" bundle
make GAME=cod4mp SOURCE_APP="/path/to/Call of Duty 4.app" bundle
```

The output apps are `build/COD4-Compat.app` and `build/COD4MP-Compat.app`.
Each contains its own copy of `Call of Duty 4 Data`; allow space for a full
additional data copy per app. No game files, Steam SDK binaries, or Apple
runtime libraries are stored in this repository. The converter reads the
Steam installation and validates the selected executable's SHA-256 before
copying. It rejects overlapping source/output paths and refuses to replace
an output that is not marked as a generated COD4 compatibility app.

`cod4-runtime` extracts two private i386 libraries from Apple's public Lion
archive, downloading approximately 4.72 GB if needed. It verifies the archive
and library checksums, mounts read-only, and never runs the installer or
changes system libraries. A previously prepared runtime can be selected with
`GUEST_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/guest-runtime` when bundling.

After runtime changes, update a previously built app without recopying data:

```sh
make GAME=cod4 promote-loader
make GAME=cod4mp promote-loader
```

The original i386 Bink and private C++ libraries run as guest code. Steam
uses the publisher's x86_64 SDK slice and the existing Steam bridge. The
proof-of-purchase request goes to the real Steam client; the legacy game's
license-key log call is redacted. This does not emulate ownership or bypass
Steam licensing.

A signature-checked in-memory patch accepts a 32-bit depth-buffer capability
alongside the original 24-bit capability. Current Apple GPUs otherwise get
rejected before display creation. The AGL adapter removes only the obsolete `AGL_FULLSCREEN` flag, preserving
attribute/value pairs and the depth and stencil requirements for the Cocoa
fullscreen window. A native pixel-format regression verifies those buffers. The original executable on disk is unchanged. The
launcher's default `-g` argument is Aspyr's own direct-game option, which
skips its obsolete Game Guide web launcher.

Apple's legacy OpenGL compiler can route texture coordinates incorrectly when
an ARB shader declares named `OUTPUT` aliases, including unused outputs. On
Apple OpenGL, the COD4 bridge expands those aliases to their explicit
`result.*` bindings before compilation. This preserves the shader instructions
and fixes the intro movies' vertical streaking. A standalone GPU regression
test checks interpolated pixel values without loading game assets.
The preprocessing also normalizes classic Mac carriage-return line endings
and preserves leading comments, blank lines and `OPTION` declarations before
inserting math guards. A GPU test covers that ordering as well as the aliases.

Mapped OpenGL buffers use low-address staging storage. Explicit range flushes
and implicit unmaps submit their uploads so that a loading context which never
presents can publish data to the rendering context. The buffer regression
covers per-object flush settings, partial ranges, and shared-context publication.

Carbon mouse coordinates are converted from the physical fullscreen panel to
the game's logical render size. Event coordinates remain available to legacy
polling until physical pointer movement supersedes them. COD4 retains a painted
main window when it moves AGL rendering to a separate fullscreen display port.
Only the display port is presented; the backing window keeps its guest visibility
and input role without appearing as an extra grey window. Leaving fullscreen
restores the backing window if the guest still wants it shown. A native SP/MP
regression covers repeated fullscreen transitions, selection, dialogs and hiding.
Windowed startup translates the obsolete positioning-bounds API's guest display
handle to the native display-ID API and packs its CGRect into an i386 Rect.
The geometry regression checks the main display, explicit handles, invalid
handles and output canaries.
COD4 input follows Carbon's front-process state rather than AppKit's cached
`isActive`, which its legacy event loop does not reliably update. Activation
restores the fullscreen presenter and its GL drawable. Deactivation releases
cursor capture and hiding, suppresses keyboard/mouse events, and freezes mouse
polling so desktop movement cannot steer the game. Guest cursor requests are
remembered and reapplied when the game becomes active. The native window test
checks presenter restoration; SP/MP dispatch tests exercise repeated background
hide, capture, warp, and mouse-poll requests without moving the host pointer.
Fullscreen activation also completes AppKit activation and reapplies the
guest's menu-bar visibility through AppKit presentation options. Previously,
Cmd-Tab could raise the game while retaining the preceding app's menu bar.
Switching away, showing the menu bar, hiding the presenter, or leaving fullscreen
restores the preceding presentation options. The SP/MP window regression checks
these transitions, repeated activation, and background-test isolation.
The Carbon event pump also completes AppKit launch and dispatches pending
`NSEventTypeAppKitDefined` events before reconciling focus. Updating presentation
properties alone left Cocoa activation stale because COD4 never runs
`NSApplication.run`. The event-delivery regression uses the real AppKit queue,
fails without the pump, and verifies that keyboard/application events remain
queued for the guest and that reentrant pumping is safe. Focus transitions log
both requested and effective system presentation state for live diagnosis.

Audio render-notify
callbacks run on the existing callback worker, including safe self-removal and
teardown; legacy byte-count audio conversion adapts to the modern packet API.
An in-game freeze was captured in `AudioUnitSetProperty(SetRenderCallback)`:
the game thread held a sound mutex while waiting for the old bridge callback's
render lock, and that callback was waiting for the same sound mutex. Unit input
bindings are now tracked separately from render locks. Replacement/removal
retires the old context without waiting; its final host render reclaims it after
copying the result. A regression reproduces the guest mutex cycle for 100
replacements/removals and checks that retired contexts are reused safely.
A later crash log places the native trap in Core Audio's `caulk` free-list
allocator during `AudioConverterNew`, with invalid free-block metadata. The
bridge was treating pre-render notifications as filled audio: it copied and
sometimes zeroed their stale buffer pointers. Pre-render notifications now
forward flags/timestamps without sample data; skipped or muted notifications
never clear buffers belonging to the audio unit. A protected-memory regression
crashes with the previous behavior and passes with the fix, including held
callbacks and preservation of a valid post-render mix. This fixes a concrete
corruption path consistent with the crash; the exact gameplay crash has not
been reproduced. `LP32_TRACE_CONVERTERS=1` logs converter formats for further
diagnosis if needed.
COD4's i386 Bink backend supplies little-endian 16-bit PCM in extended Sound
Manager headers. The bridge preserves that byte order for both editions;
marking those buffers big-endian caused static in movies and mission briefings.
Explicit compressed-header format tags (`sowt`, `twos`, `NONE`) retain their
specified interpretation. The regression reads the actual native audio queue's
format and checks decoded sample polarity and amplitude for both byte orders.
Bink buffers also match independent movie decoding (correlation above
0.999999 for the IW and Aspyr logos). A live capture of `cargoship_load.bik`
confirmed repeated silent gaps between approximately 40 ms Sound Manager
buffers. The bridge now submits upcoming PCM before earlier buffers finish,
while retiring commands and invoking guest callbacks in order. Format changes
wait for queued audio to drain, and stop/flush invalidates pending completions.
A native offline-render regression checks sample continuity across four
buffers, copied-data ownership, callback order, and cancellation.
The radio hiss in the captured briefing matches the original soundtrack;
several uninterrupted segments correlated above 0.999 with independent decoding.
A campaign output probe also captured the final native mix with finite samples
and no clipping. Speaker playback across a full session remains unverified.

A separate gameplay capture investigated crackle beside the cargo-ship package,
just before the manifest instruction. After subtracting the matching HQ voice
and ship ambience, the remaining clicks matched the original mission's
`items/item_geiger_counter_lvl1.wav` and `lvl2.wav` PCM (approximately
0.96–0.99 correlation across selected click sequences). These loaded sounds
are embedded in `cargoship.ff`, rather than the loose dialogue WAV archives.
The mission's `package_radiation()` script explicitly plays these loops near
the container. The bundled mission file was byte-identical to Steam's copy.
Muted, isolated replays of the HQ WAV through the guest sound engine, both
resident and streamed, did not reproduce the extra clicks. No audio filtering
or runtime change was made for this captured Geiger-counter effect; this
finding does not establish the cause of other, uncaptured audio problems.

The BSD socket bridge converts resolver pointer arrays and 32-bit timeouts.
Its loopback regression includes a complete burst of COD4 setup fragments:
thirteen 1,310-byte datagrams and a shorter final fragment, with byte and
buffer-boundary checks.

An Internet connection stuck at “Setting up game” was traced to the active
Cloudflare WARP MASQUE tunnel (MTU 1,300). Only the final, shorter setup
fragment reached `recvfrom`; the thirteen full-size fragments never arrived.
The client kept receiving heartbeats and rejecting the incomplete setup.
After WARP was disabled by the user, the same unmodified socket/parser code
received the full fragments and proceeded to mod downloads. Keep WARP off
for this connection, or explicitly configure a server exclusion in WARP;
the app does not change VPN settings or bypass the tunnel itself.

Multiplayer bundles allow legacy HTTP downloads through
`NSAppTransportSecurity.NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`. COD4 uses `NSURLDownload`
with URLs supplied by game servers, so a fixed host exception cannot cover
the server browser. Without this setting, the modern host executable adds
ATS restrictions absent from the original game; macOS logs error `-1022`,
and the game reports a generic download failure. Both the Python bundler
and standalone converter apply this setting to MP only. A live test fetched
`zz_mf.iwd` and `mod.ff` from the server's HTTP host and reached the active
map after this change. The tested server then displayed its own relocation
notice and redirected to a replacement server, where Overgrown loaded and
the team-selection menu appeared. No unsupported imports were encountered.

A separate zero-byte stall had two causes. The public mod host at
`188.165.57.239` rejected Foundation's default `CFNetwork` user-agent with
HTTP 403, while the Carbon game loop could leave the download delegate's
progress and completion/error callbacks pending. MP now supplies
`COD4MPCompat/1.7.2` when a download request has no explicit user-agent, and
services ready default-run-loop callbacks when the original `DownloadDelegate`
is polled. Failed downloads also log their native error. The same host's
6,105,021-byte `~images_00.iwd` completed through the original i386 downloader,
with a SHA-256 matching a direct download. `make test-cod4-download` checks
intermediate progress, exact contents, redirects, HTTP 403, and truncated
responses using a loopback server and the shipped guest delegate.

The multiplayer server-name comparator calls Darwin's `__maskrune` when a
hostname contains a high-bit byte. A captured Join Game freeze stopped at that
missing import with byte `0xc3` (the start of a UTF-8 sequence). The bridge now
implements its signed-rune/32-bit-mask ABI. The server-browser regression runs
12,291 comparisons through the original MP function, including UTF-8, every
high-bit byte, reversed operands and equal names.

COD4's dynamic `dlopen`, `dlsym`, `dlclose` and `dlerror` imports now use the
same i386 loader as Bink and the private C++ runtime. Previously native
`dlopen` rejected the bundled 32-bit PunkBuster modules and the game displayed
“Unable to initialize Punkbuster.” The original `pbcl.mac`, `pbag.mac` and
`pbsv.mac` loaded and initialized with PunkBuster enabled in a separate test
profile; the game reached its main menu without that error. Native system
libraries still use typed ABI bridges. Modules remain pinned for callback
safety. This verifies startup, not acceptance by a PunkBuster-protected server.

## Tests and diagnostics

A later campaign freeze was captured with the game thread waiting on a sound's
mutex while its worker looped inside the host sample-rate converter. The guest
was providing valid looping PCM, but the default macOS SRC did not finish a
fill after the requested output changed from 470 to 471 frames. A standalone
native reproduction used the captured 13,544 Hz planar stereo int16 input and
44,100 Hz mono float output and failed on the second fill. PCM converters that
change sample rate now select the native minimum-phase SRC, preserving filter
history across fills. Equal-rate conversion is unchanged. The bridge regression
covers 16,384 alternating-size fills across four rates, reset, output samples,
and buffer guards; its bounded input callback makes the original infinite loop
fail promptly instead of hanging the test.

Both COD4 modes enable the bounded hitch recorder automatically. Reports go to
`~/Library/Logs/COD4Compat/hitches-*.log` or
`~/Library/Logs/COD4MPCompat/hitches-*.log`. The AGL swap path records CPU work
and buffer presentation separately, with exclusive import timings and nearby
worker events. The default threshold is 50 ms because some original loading
screens intentionally redraw at 30 Hz. `LP32_HITCH_LOG=0` disables recording;
`LP32_HITCH_LOG=/path/to/new.log` selects a file and `LP32_HITCH_MS` overrides
the threshold. Reports retain 32 preceding and eight following frames, with a
five-second cooldown and a limit of 128 reports per process. These are CPU wall
times, not GPU execution measurements.

Recorder v3 counts frequent memory/string operations, character conversion and
thread-ID queries in `counted_runtime` without timing every invocation. Their
time stays in total frame work and any enclosing timed import. Allocation,
locks, I/O, graphics and audio still receive individual timings. Set
`LP32_HITCH_FULL_IMPORTS=1` before launch to restore full import timing; this
adds measurable overhead in loading loops. Worker calls do not contribute to
the render thread's counted total.

A separate, muted 1024x768 campaign probe reproduced a `cargoship` loading gap
of 2.25 seconds as the asset counter jumped from 98/318 to 318/318. Presentation
took 2.3 ms; the delay was in CPU work between redraws. Import profiling found
millions of string operations and thread-ID queries repeating the slow bridge
dispatch. Those operations now use the existing memoized handler mechanism,
with the same guest ABI and libc behavior. The comparable loading gap fell to
0.92–0.94 seconds across two repeats on the M5 Pro test host (the original
path took 2.25–2.27 seconds across two runs). That optimization reduced loading
time but did not keep the screen animating during synchronous guest work. The i386
runtime fixtures exercise first and cached calls, signed comparisons, string
copy returns and padding, case conversion, and thread identity.

The next live session captured repeated 471–485 ms pauses with roughly 2.5
million runtime calls per frame. The live sample continued rendering rather
than waiting on the earlier audio lock. In paired `cargoship` probes, the v2
recorder extended the loading gap from 647–658 ms to 924–942 ms. Counting the
frequent pure runtime calls and memoizing zlib's streaming adapters brought
recorded loading gaps to 722–753 ms across two runs. Those optimizations alone
still left a visible pause in the badge animation.

An isolated copy of the user's `hunted-11` checkpoint also exposed over 716,000
small `inflate` calls in its restoration phase. Memoized `inflate`/`deflate`
handlers use the same stream adapter as ordinary dispatch, preserving input,
output, checksums, error returns and guest allocator callbacks. With detailed
profiling enabled in both runs, time in those inflate calls fell from 205 ms
to 26 ms and the associated frame from 326 ms to 149 ms. These figures describe
that restoration phase; they do not measure the badge redraw fix below. The zlib
regression exercises direct and chained calls, incremental output, reset,
invalid streams, ownership and buffer guards.

The SP loading-screen patch now keeps the original cinematic badge and progress
bar redrawing during synchronous mission initialization. A guest stack trace
placed the long no-present interval inside `SV_InitGameProgs`: script parsing
and compilation, entity creation, and the level's initial script execution.
Meanwhile, the database thread advanced from roughly one third to all of its
fastfile blocks without a single screen refresh.

Signature-checked i386 hooks yield to the existing `SCR_UpdateLoadScreen` at
`Scr_LoadScriptInternal` and `G_ParseSpawnVars` entry, and at the VM's existing
loop timer check. They only redraw on the main thread with `cls.state == 3`;
the original recursion guard, 33 ms throttle, cinematic clock and progress
counters remain in charge. The hooks run outside string/database critical
sections and preserve the original stack arguments and timer return value.
MP and the other titles have no loading-screen patch profile.

With default hitch recording enabled, two isolated `cargoship` loads had
65.1–67.8 ms maximum frame gaps after tracked mission loading began, versus the
previous roughly 0.8-second stall. `hunted` improved from 694.8 to 52.4 ms.
A separate frame capture verified that the SAS badge rotates and the bar
advances through the formerly frozen interval (capture overhead raised its
maximum gap to 83.8 ms). These are measurements of the animated mission-loading
phase, not a promise of hitch-free rendering: preparing the first badge frame
still took 0.17–0.31 seconds before the emblem appeared in these runs.

The runtime test creates tiny original i386 fixtures, requiring neither game
data nor Steam. It exercises classic and compressed relocations, a universal
dylib, high preferred addresses, dependency constructors, repeated lookup,
malformed-image rollback, context jumps, signal masks, and libc return/write
ABI. Guest fixtures also open and call guest and host libraries through the
actual dl* imports and check error consumption. The server-browser test
requires a built MP bundle and does not open game UI or contact servers.
Initializer tests load the selected game's dependencies and initializers
without entering the game's main or opening Steam/game UI.

For development probes, set `LP32_TEST_HOME_DIR` and
`LP32_APPLICATION_SUPPORT_DIR` to a temporary home/support directory and
`LP32_COD4_PREFERENCES_ID` to a separate preferences domain. Set
`LP32_BACKGROUND_TEST=1 LP32_MUTE_AUDIO=1` for background probes.
`LP32_FAIL_ON_UNSUPPORTED_IMPORT=1` exits with status 78 on an unsupported
import, including imports reached from event callbacks. Without that option,
the normal controlled guest-escape diagnostic remains available.
